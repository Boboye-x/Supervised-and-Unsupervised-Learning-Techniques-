This study investigate
d the use of machine learning models, including regres sion, clustering,
and neural networks, to predict global video game sales. Various models were evaluated
using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R². Results showed that multiple linear regression
and random forest achieved high accuracy, with R² values of 0.9 9 and 0.98, respectively.
Among the artificial neural networks, Model 3 performed best with an MSE of 0.02.
Unsupervised models, particularly agglomerative clustering, outperformed k means. The
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in sales prediction, with future
research focusing on the impact of categorical variables like genre and platform
